# Full-Stack-Course-Meta-Course-
This repository contains my complete notes, code, and project work from the Meta Full-Stack Developer Specialization on Coursera. It covers front-end and back-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django, Databases, Git, and APIs, helping me build production-ready full-stack web applications.
